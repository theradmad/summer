Please assist me in extracting valid information from a given natural language text and reconstructing it in JSON format, as demonstrated in the following example.
In the JSON, "org" denotes the departure city. "dest" denotes the destination city. "days" denotes the total number of travel days. When "days" exceeds 3, "visiting_city_number" specifies the number of cities to be covered in the destination state. "date" includes the detailed date to visit.
In addition, "local_constraint" contains four possible constraints. Possible options of "house rule" includes ["parties", "smoking", "children under 10", "pets", "visitors"]. Possible options of "cuisine" includes ["Chinese", "American", "Italian", "Mexican", "Indian", "Mediterranean", "French"]. Possible options of "house type" includes ["entire room", "private room", "shared room", "not shared room"]. Possible options of "transportation" includes ["no flight", "no self-driving"]. If neither are mentioned in the text, make the value to be null. 
Here are three examples:
